README for SingletonLab (Updated Configuration Class):
SingletonLab - Configuration Class

This is an example Java program demonstrating the implementation of a thread-safe singleton pattern for a configuration class using double-checked locking.
Description

The Configuration class in this project represents a singleton configuration manager. It reads configuration data from a config.properties file and stores it in a HashMap. The class ensures that only one instance of the configuration manager is created, making it suitable for use in multi-threaded environments.
Usage

To use the Configuration class in your project:

    Clone or download this repository.

    Include the Configuration.java class in your project.

    Access the configuration values using the Configuration.getInstance().getValue(key) method.
